# CSCI2275-GameCompare
Final project for CSCI 2275 by Nikita Feoktistov

Project Summary:
The purpose of this project is to allow users to input, and save, what games they and their friends have, and later compare them to see what games people have in common.
You can choose to create a priority queue of games that is organized based on amount of people that have the game. The project will save all updates made into a file 
once you are done.


How to run:
Once the files are downloaded, you must enter "people.txt" as a command line argument. I have included a sample file, however, to run the project you should start off
with a file containing at least one person with one game. From there, choose the option you want. You must create the queue before you enqueue anything. All of the inputs
are programmed to not be caps sensitive.

Dependencies:
Vector, iostream, fstream, sstream, and string classes.

Team members:
Just me :)

Contributors:
Tyler Vanessen helped me with troubleshooting my code.

Open Issues/Bugs:
None that I know of so far.
