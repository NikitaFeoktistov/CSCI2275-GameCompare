# CSCI2275-GameCompare
Final project for CSCI 2275 by Nikita Feoktistov

The purpose of this project is to allow users to input, and save, what games they and their friends have, and later compare them to see what games people have in common.
It uses a linked list generated from a file to find what games people have, and a priority queue organized based on how many people have that game.
